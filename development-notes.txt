Use Dagger-2 instead of Guice?

Ideas:
  In properties, note that depending on the property, empty values may fall back
  to the default value, or not.

  The log files: if the name is kept empty, the log files will not be configured
  - a user supplied log4j representation has to do that.
  Allow a property for the regular class log file.
  Implement an interface to programmatically modify the log4j settings.

 - Could the object lists be modeled using an ECS like artemis-odb? Problem:
   LDMud is inherently single-threaded, so command execution and timing are
   interleaved. LDMud's programming interface is OO - an ECS mud might require
   a completely different approach. That said, an ECS might simplify the
   implementation of the backend loop, even if the gamelogic itself is
   still OO.
