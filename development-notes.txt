Ideas:
  In properties, note that depending on the property, empty values may fall back
  to the default value, or not.

  The log files: if the name is kept empty, the log files will not be configured
  - a user supplied log4j representation has to do that.
  Allow a property for the regular class log file.
  Implement an interface to programmatically modify the log4j settings.
