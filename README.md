A Java implementation of the LDMud game driver.

This is not meant to be a replacement for the C-based official LDMud game
driver (see http://www.ldmud.eu/); instead it is a pet project to teach
myself /real/ advanced Java programming.

Updates are going to be sporadically, and there will be lots of wrong
decisions and dead ends. But ultimately, I am curious how the performance of a
Java-based mud interpreter would stack up against the finely-tuned
C-implementation.
